- 👋 Hi, I’m @BahamaDev
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Crypto, Space Exploration and Cigars. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Development: Javascript, CSS, HTML and the relative basic of being any sort of developer. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. Any projects where I can stretch my skill and be introduced to more real world use cases.
- 📫 How to reach me. Email is best: valthedev@gmail.com.
